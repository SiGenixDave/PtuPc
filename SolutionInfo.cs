 * 
 *                                          8.  SNCR001.29. Added support for a security tag associated with each workset to prevent accidental deletion of worksets.

 *                                              the target. If a mismatch is detected the PTU will attempt to load the correct data dictionary.
 * 
 *                                          4.  Modified the Common.WorksetCollection class so that any previously defined worksets will continue to work if any watch 
 *                                              variables are added to or removed from the data dictionary, provided that all of the watch variables defined in the

 * 
 *                                          5.  Bug fix - SNCR001.51/56. Modified the FormWatchView class so that all worksets attached to the Items property of the 
 *                                              ToolStripComboBox control are updated if any of the worksets are modified.
 * 
 *                                          6.  Included support for dynamic update of the event log display if new events are detected while the event log is on display.
 * 
 *                                          7.  Bug fix SNCR001.66. Modified the Event.FormSetupStream class to save the current event log to disk and then clear it down 
 *                                              before updating the data stream parameters. If this is not carried out, any attempt to view a data stream generated before 
 *                                              the parameters were modified will display incorrect results as the values will correspond to the watch identifiers
 *                                              associated with the previous parameters, however, they will be interpreted as being the values associated with the updated
 *                                              parameters.
 * 
 *                                          8.  SNCR001.72. Included the facility to load multiple files when viewing saved event log files.
 * 
 *  01/10/11    6.4.1       K.McD           1.  Minor bug fixes in preparation for release:
 *                                                  (a) Modified the constructor of Common.FormWatchReplay to initialize the timer used to play back the recorded data.
 *                                                  (b) Modified the PathRelativePTUApplicationData resource in Common.dll as a temporary fix so that the default directory for PTU application data 
 *                                                      is 'ProgramData/Bombardier/Portable Test Unit'.
 *                                                  (c) Modified the GetStream() method of the Event.CommunicationEvent class to set the data stream number to be equal to 
 *                                                      the event record index + 1.
 * 
 *  01/12/11    6.4.2       K.McD           1.  Bug fix SNCR001.84. Added the second parameter to all calls to the System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne() method, as advised by 
 *                                              the following blog entries:

 * 
 *  01/14/11    6.4.3       K.McD           1.  Bug fix SNCR001.85. There appears to be a bug in the CheckFaultLogger() method of the PTUDLL322 dynamic link library in
 *                                              that the event count value returned from the call can sometimes increment by the number of existing entries in the event
 *                                              log every time that the call is made. This problem is sometimes cleared by calling the ClearEvent() method the same
 *                                              library, however, in order to circumvent the problem the design of the dynamic update of the event log was modified to use
 *                                              the event index value that is returned from the call instead as this value is correct. 
 * 
 *                                              The bug fix is implemented by adding an EventIndex property to the Event.FormViewEventLog class in conjunction with a 
 *                                              modification to the Run() method of the Event.ThreadPollEvent class.
 * 
 *  01/17/11    6.4.4       K.McD           1.  Bug fix - SNCR001.86. Under the previous implementation, if a workset contained less than WatchSize watch variables, 
 *                                              there was a possibility that the display values associated with one or more watch variables would, under certain 
 *                                              circumstances, be incorrect. This bug was caused because not all elements of the m_WatchElements array were updated in 
 *                                              the SetWatchElements() method if the new workset being displayed contained less than WatchSize entries.
 * 
 *                                              This problem was addressed by making the following modifications:
 *                                              (a) Used the Array.Copy() method to copy the watchElementList parameter to the initialized watchElements array in the 
 *                                                  Watch.CommunicationWatch.SetWatchElements() method. This ensures that all WatchSize watch elements are updated when 
 *                                                  making a call to the PTUDLL32.SetWatchElements() method. The watch identifiers of those watch elements that are not 
 *                                                  used are set to 0.
 * 
 *                                              (b) Modified the for loop within the SetWatchElements() method of the Watch.CommunicationWatch class to update all 
 *                                                  elements of the m_WatchElements array.
 * 
 *                                          2.  Removed the SimulateCommunicationLink conditional compilation.
 * 
 *  01/18/11    6.4.5       K.McD           1.  Bug fix SNCR001.79 - In previous releases, the contents of the data streams associated with some of the events 
 *                                              occasionally had all watch variable values set to 0. This bug has been addressed by correcting the stream number value 
 *                                              passed to the call to the PTUDLL32.GetStream() method in Event.CommunicationEvent.GetStream(). 
 * 
 *                                              The data stream number associated with each event record is determined as follows. Starting from the oldest event record, 
 *                                              whenever an event record is found that has an associated data stream, the stream number for the event record is incremented 
 *                                              from a starting value of 0. Any event record that does not have an associated data stream will have the stream number set 
 *                                              to CommonConstants.NotUsed.
 * 
 *                                          2.  Bug fix - SNCR001.87. When attempting to download a datastream using the latest version of the CTA embedded software 
 *                                              a System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException was thrown. 
 * 
 *                                              The bug fix was implemented by modifying the value of the DefaultWatchSizeFaultLog constant in the Parameter class to 20 
 *                                              to cater for the increased number of data stream parameters associated with the Propulsion, Engineering and Snapshot 
 *                                              event logs on the CTA project.
 * 
 *  01/26/11    6.4.6       K.McD           1.  Request (B-03005) - SNCR001.48. Modified the design so that the: (1) fault log data streams, (2) application data
 *                                              directory, (3) WatchSize and (4) VCU sample interval are configured using the data dictionary.
 * 
 *  01/26/11    6.4.6.1     K.McD           1.  Bug fix SNCR001.97. Modified the ConvertToWorkset() method of the CommunicationEvent class to use the 
 *                                              Parameter.WatchSizeFaultLogMax constant to specify the entryCountMax parameter when instantiating the Workset_t structure.
 * 
 *  01/27/11    6.4.7       K.McD           1.  Request - SNCR001.68/57. Modified the Event.FormViewEventLog class to save, clear and reset ALL event logs rather than 
 *                                              just the current event log when the user presses the appropriate function keys on the event log display.
 * 
 *                                          2.  Request - SNCR001.72. Included a feature whereby the user can save the event logs to an individual event log XML 
 *                                              file or append the events to an existing file.
 * 
 *                                          3.  Bug fix - SNCR001.88/89. Modified the ShowDataStreamFile() method of the Common.MenuInterface class to return a flag 
 *                                              to indicate whether the selected data stream file is valid and used this in the overridden ShowDataStreamFile() 
 *                                              methods in the child Event.MenuInterfaceEvent and Watch.MenuInterface.Watch classes such that the data stream file 
 *                                              is only displayed if the selected file is valid.
 * 
 *                                          4.  Modified the Common.CommunicationParent class to include a mutex to ensure that multiple processes can't access the 
 *                                              serial port at the same time.
 * 
 *                                          5.  Request - SNCR001.73. Created the Event.MenuInterfaceEvent.ImportEventLogFiles() method to allow the user 
 *                                              to use the Windows multi-select feature to load a number of event log files.
 * 
 *                                          6.  Modified the form used to display and record watch variables, Watch.FormWatchView, so that: (a) the escape key is no longer
 *                                              disabled while in record mode (b) access to the main menu options is disabled while in record mode and (c) if the 
 *                                              user exits the form or the application while in record mode the recording will be cleanly terminated and the existing 
 *                                              data will be saved to disk before the application is closed.
 * 
 *  02/04/11    6.4.7.1     K.McD           1.  Removed those menu options that are not required for the CTA project.
 * 
 *  02/14/11    6.4.7.2     K.McD           1.  Added support for debug mode; this allows users to log the parameter values associated with all calls to the methods 
 *                                              associated with the PTUDLL32 dynamic link library.
 * 
 *                                          2.  Bug fix - SNCR001.100/53. Added the UpdateMenu() virtual method to the CommonFormPTU class; this re-applies any form 
 *                                              specific changes to the main menu that were applied after the form was instantiated. Used following a change to 
 *                                              the security level of the user and this action will 'reset' the main menu to its initial state.
 * 
 *                                          3.  Bug fix - SNCR001.40. Modified the FormShowSystemInformation class so that the button used to show the form which allows 
 *                                              the user to configure the real time clock is only enabled if the user is logged into engineering mode.
 * 
 *                                          4.  Modified the MdiPTU.Support class to include code within the UpdateMenu() method to call the UpdateMenu() function 
 *                                              of any child classes that are open. This ensures that any form specific changes to the menu system are updated whenever 
 *                                              the security level of the user is changed.
 * 
 *  02/21/11    6.4.7.3     K.McD           1.  Modified the Watch library such that the name of the workset is included in the default filename of saved watch files.
 *                                          2.  Modified the Event library such that it no longer requires the sample interval value when configuring the fault log 
 *                                              worksets..
 *                                          3.  Modified the Event library such that it no longer clears the current log before downloading new data stream parameters.
 * 
 *  02/28/11    6.4.7.4     K.McD           1.  Minor reorganization of the menu system.
 * 
 *                                          2.  Removed the button that allows the user to modify the VCU date and time from the FormShowSystemInformation class.
 * 
 *                                          3.  Modified the DoubleClick event handler of those user controls derived from the Common.WatchControl class such that if 
 *                                              the user control is not write enabled and the user attempts to modify the current value, the information message reported 
 *                                              to the user will differentiate between a read-only watch variable and one where the current security level is insufficient 
 *                                              to allow the user to modify the value.
 * 
 *                                          4.  Modified the Common.FormDataStreamReplay class to display the appropriate text and image on the escape key ToolStrip button
 *                                              and return to the correct form when the escape key is pressed.
 * 
 *                                          5.  Included support to manage the Visible property of the main application progress bar as this is no longer permanently on 
 *                                              display.
 * 
 *                                          6.  Added an event handler for the context menu Opened event to the Common.FormWorksetManager class so that the Enabled 
 *                                              property of each context menu is set or cleared depending upon the selected context menu and current security level.
 *                                   
 *                                          7.  Modified the event handler for the 'Set As Default' context menu option associated with the Common.FormWorksetManager class 
 *                                              to ensure that the security level of the workset that has been set is assigned to the highest security level.
 * 
 *                                          8.  Bug fix SNCR001.105. Modified the event handler associated with the F5-Edit function key of the Watch.FormViewWatch class 
 *                                              to check that the user has sufficient privileges before showing the dialog box that allows the user to edit the current 
 *                                              workset.
 * 
 *                                          9.  Bug fix SNCR001.105. Added the UpdateMenu() override method to the FormViewWatch class to process any form specific changes
 *                                              to the menu system or function keys resulting from a change in the security level of the user.
 * 
 *                                          10. Modified the Watch.FormViewWatch class such that the progress bar is only displayed when data is being recorded.
 * 
 *                                          11. Modified the LoadWorkset() method of the Watch.FormViewWatch class such that the F5-Edit function key is only enabled 
 *                                              if the security level allows the user to modify the current workset.
 * 
 *                                          12. Bug fix. Modified the CheckFaultlogger() method of the Event.CommunicationEvent class such that the newIndex local variable
 *                                              used in the call to the PTUDLL32.CheckFaultLogger() method in not initilalized to zero.
 * 
 *                                          13. Modified the InitializeEventLogs() method of the Event.MenuInterfaceEvent class to ask for user confirmation before 
 *                                              proceeding.
 * 
 *                                          14. Bug fix. Improved the layout of the event log display and fixed the AccessViolation exception thrown following the 
 *                                              download of a data stream.
 * 
 *                                          15. Added event handlers for the Shown events raised by the Event.FormViewFaultLog and Event.FormOpenFaultLog classes to 
 *                                              modify the image and text of the escape key ToolStrip button if the forms were called from the form used to display the 
 *                                              event log rather than the main application window as under these circumstances the escape key will return the user to 
 *                                              that form rather than home.
 * 
 *                                          16. Modified the event handler for the Save function key Click event of the Event.FormSetupStream class to ask for confirmation
 *                                              before updating a saved workset.
 * 
 *                                          17. Modified the Event.FormSetupStream class such that the combo box control is now used to both display the name of the 
 *                                              workset and to select a new workset.
 * 
 *  03/01/11    6.4.7.5     K.McD           1.  Corrected the parameters passed to the DeriveName() method in the Common.General.GetFullyQualifiedFaulLogFilename()
 *                                              methods.
 *                                          
 *                                          2.  Modified the event handler for the 'F5-Trip' function key 'Click' event in the Common.FormDataStreamReplay class such that,
 *                                              if an entry corresponding to the time of the trip is not found, the 'F5-Trip' function key is unchecked and the cursor is 
 *                                              set to the default cursor.
 * 
 *  03/02/11    6.4.7.6     K.McD       1.  Modified the Event.FormViewEventLog and Event.FormOpenEventLog classes such that the EventRecordList property is sorted by 
 *                                          descending date/time order, i.e. most recent event first, so that the first row of the DataGridView control is selected 
 *                                          when the forms are first shown.
 * 
 *                                      2.  Modified the DataGridView SortCompare() event handler in the Event.FormViewEventLog class such that the value stored in 
 *                                          the Log column of the DataGridView control is ignored when determining the sort order.
 * 
 *  03/21/11    6.4.7.7     K.McD       1.  Modified the design of the Event.FormViewEventLog class such that when displaying the event variables associated with the 
 *                                          selected event only those event variable user controls which are specific to the selected event are re-configured. 
 * 
 *                                      2.  Modified the philosopy used to find the selected event in the list of loaded event records for the FormOpenEventLog class. 
 *                                          The event record list is now sorted by DateTime order, oldest event first and the event index of each record is updated so 
 *                                          that it is unique and matches the sort order of the list i.e. 0 will represent the oldest event, 1 the following event etc. 
 *                                          When the user selects a row from the DataGridView control, the index of the event corresponding to the selected row is 
 *                                          determined and the list of event records is searched for a match.
 * 
 *                                      3.  Modified the WriteDataSetToXml() method of the Common.DataDictionary class to include try/catch blocks for those tables 
 *                                          that are not automatically created by the data dictionary builder utility in case those tables have not been manually 
 *                                          added to the data dictionary.
 * 
 *                                      4.  Added support for the Security table of the Access 'E1' database and modified the Common.Security class to use the security 
 *                                          configuration parameters defined in this table.
 * 
 *                                      5.  Added the WinHlp32 class to support the Windows help engine.
 * 
 *                                      6.  Modified the LoadDataDictionary() method of the Common.General class such that the same call to the FileInfo.CopyTo() method 
 *                                          is made nomatter whether the destination file exists or not.
 * 
 *                                      7.  Modified the AppendEventRecordList() method of the FileHandling class to include a match for the event index in the 
 *                                          Find() method call used when trying to check for duplicate records. This was added to cater for the case where multiple 
 *                                          events with the same description and date/time stamp are generated by the VCU, but with different event variable information 
 *                                          e.g. in the case of the 'Inverter Fault' event.
 * 
 *                                      8.  Modified the watch and event user controls to:
 *                                              (a) include support for diagnostic help information.
 *                                              (b) ensure that an exception is not thrown and to correctly handle the case where an invalid watch identifier is specified 
 *                                                  for the Identifier property of the control.
 * 
 *                                      9.  Modified the FormShowFlags class to support the FormShowFlagsEvent child class and created the FormShowFlagsEvent child class 
 *                                          to display the state of individual bits within an event bitmask variable.
 * 
 *                                      10. Added the CopyTo() method to the EventVariable class to allow the selected event variable to be copied to a newly instantiated 
 *                                          event variable.
 * 
 *                                      11. Bug fix - SNCR001.114. Modified the CreateEventVariableList() of the EventTable class to create a list of newly instantiated 
 *                                          event variables to store the event variable values associated with the the specified event identifier.
 * 
 *                                      12  Added the ConfigureRealTimeClock() method to the MenuInterfaceApplication class.
 * 
 *                                      13. Modified the design of the FormConfigureDateTime class such that the form is now self sufficient i.e. it is no longer called 
 *                                          from the FormShowSystemInformation class.
 * 
 *                                      14. Modified the design of the FormLogin class such that user simply enters the password associated with the required security 
 *                                          level to log into the account i.e. the required security level need not be selected from a drop down list.
 * 
 *                                      15.  Removed the feature to allow the user to configure the VCU date and time from within the form used to show the system
 *                                          information.
 * 
 *  03/28/11    6.4.7.8     K.McD       1.  Bug fix SNCR001.112. Modified the application to use the old identifier field of the data dictionary rather 
 *                                          than the watch identifier field to define the watch variables that are to be included in each workset as these remain 
 *                                          consistent following a data dictionary update.
 * 
 *                                      2.  Added the Common.WatchVariableTableByOldIdentifier class to support access to the watch variables defined in the data 
 *                                          dictionary using the old identifier field of the watch variables.
 * 
 *  03/31/11    6.4.7.9     K.McD       1.  SNCR001.025. Added support for the enumerator user control.
 *                                      2.  SNCR001.062. Included support to write the y axis values and the cursor value in the format specified by the FORMATSTRING 
 *                                          field of the data dictionary.
 * 
 *  04/06/11    6.4.8       K.McD       1.  Added support to allow the user to configure the event flags associated with the current log.
 *                                      2.  Added support to show the event history.
 *                                      3.  SNCR001.115. Modified the Common.FormShowHeaderInformation class such that the username field displays the saved username 
 *                                          rather than the current Windows username.

 *                                      6.  Updated SelfTest.dll (1.3.16).
 *                                              1.  Modified the constructor of the FormViewTetResults class such that the call to ExitSelfTestTask(), issued in case the
 *                                                  Self Test task on the hardware is already running, is not made if the project identifier corresponds to the

 *                                          
 * 07/16/13     6.7.1   K.McD       1.  Updated Event.dll to version 1.17.2.
 * 
 *                                          1.  Modified the FormViewFaultLog class - 1.17.1. Added a try/catch block to the F3 function key event handler to prevent an
 *                                              exception being thrown in the event that the number of records in m_HistoricDataManager.AllFrames is less that the
 *                                              TripIndex value of the current DataStream type. This can occur if the DataStreamType field of the Logs table in the
 *                                              .E1 database is set up incorrectly.
 * 
 *                                          2.  Modified the FormGetStream class - 1.17.2.
 *                                              1.  Renamed the constants:
 *                                                  a.  DataStreamTypeFaultLog to DataStreamTypeStandardFaultLog
 *                                                  b.  DurationSecDownloadFaultLog to DurationSecDownloadStandardFaultLog.
 *                                              
 *                                              2.  Modified the XML tags associated with the updated constants.
 *                                      
 *                                              3.  Modified the default case of the switch(dataStreamTypeIdentifier) statement in the constructor to set the 
 *                                                  progress bar parameters and thread complete timeout to be the same as those for the standard fault log in 
 *                                                  case additional datastream types are added to the DataStreamType table of the .E1 database.
 *                                          
 *                                                  This modification arose because a new datastream type was added to the DataStreamType table of the .E1 database 
 *                                                  to define the fault log datastream associated with the R188 project. The datastream associated with this project 
 *                                                  is identical to that of the standard fault log however the trip time index i.e. the sample corresponding to the 
 *                                                  time of the actual trip is 25 rather than 75. When trying to download the fault log with this new datastream 
 *                                                  type the download would terminate immediately and report that the PTU was unable to download the fault log as the 
 *                                                  download complete timeout had not been initialized.
 *                                                  
 *  07/16/13    6.7.2   K.McD       1.  Updated Common.dll to version 1.18.1. Modified the PathPTUConfigurationFiles property of the DirectoryManager class to use the
 *                                      '\Bombardier\Portable Test Unit\PTU Configuration Files' sub-directory of the directory that serves as the common repository for
 *                                      the current roaming user (User Application Data directory) rather than the startup directory.
 *                                      
 *  07/24/13    6.7.3   K.McD       1.  Updated Common.dll to version 1.18.2.
 *                                          1.  To allow the form that is used to configure the fault log parameters to display the number of watch variables associated
 *                                              with the current event log and to check that the configured number of watch variables does not exceed the permitted limit,
 *                                              the following changes were implemented:
 *                                              
 *                                                  1.  Modified the BuildDataStreamTypeParametersTable() method of the LogTable class to include the WatchVariablesMax
 *                                                      field from the DataStreamTypes table.
 *                                                  2.  Added the WatchVariablesMax variable to the DataStreamTypeParameters_t structure.
 *                                                  3.  Added the WatchVariablesMax field to the DataStreamTypes table of DataDictonary.mdb.
 *                                                  4.  Updated DataDictionary.xsd to reflect the modified structure of the DataStreamType table. Note: Automatic update of
 *                                                      DataDictionary.Designer.cs.
 *                                                  5.  Modified the FormWorksetDefine class to allow the EntryCountMax property to be updated by child classes.
 *                                                      
 *                                          2.  Added the WatchSizeFaultLog and SupportsMultipleDataStreamTypes properties to the Parameter class and replaced all
 *                                              references to the Parameter.WatchSizeFaultLogMax constant with references to the property throughout. Instead of the
 *                                              number of watch variables associated with the Fault Log worksets being constant it is now derived from the 
 *                                              value of the WatchVariablesMax field of the DataStreamTypes table in the data dictionary. The class also determines if
 *                                              the number of fault logs that can be recorded by each event log is fixed and, if so, asserts the
 *                                              SupportsMultipleDataStreamTypes flag.
 *                                              
 * 
 *                                  2.  Updated Event.dll to version 1.17.3.
 *                                          1.  Now passes the reference to the current event log to the form that is used to configure the fault log parameters so that a
 *                                              check can be made on the number of watch variables that are currently configured before attempting to download them to the
 *                                              VCU.
 *                                              
 *                                          2.  Now displays the number of watch variables that are associated with the current event log on the form used to configure the
 *                                              fault log parameters.
 *                                          
 *                                          3.  Modified the form that is used to configure the fault log worksets so that the allowed number of watch variables is
 *                                              displayed on the form if the number of watch variables recorded by every event log is fixed. On projects, such as CTA,
 *                                              where the number of watch variables that can be recorded by various event logs is not fixed e.g. the snapshot log can
 *                                              record 20 watch variables whereas the propulsion and engineering logs can only record 16, the form only displays the number
 *                                              of watch variables that have been configured so far. For such projects the PTU does not know whether the user is defining a
 *                                              workset for the snaphot, propulsion or engineering event log and it is the responsibility of the user to define the correct
 *                                              number of watch variables for the workset.
 *                                              
 *                                  3.  Updated Watch.dll to version 1.22.1.
 *                                          1.  Bug fix to enable the user to use Windows Terminal to download the embedded software to the COM-C card if the 'Flash
 *                                              Programming Enabled' flag is asserted. Asserting this flag terminates the normal master/slave PTU communications link at
 *                                              the COM-C COM port and puts the port into terminal mode.
 *                                      
 *                                                  1.  Modified the Exit() method of the FormViewWatch class to close the communication port and to set the mode to
 *                                                      configuration mode if there is a communication fault or the watchdog has tripped i.e. the port is locked.
 *                                          
 *                                                  2.  Modified the Run() method of the ThreadPollWatch class such that if a communication fault is detected, instead of
 *                                                      trying to re-establish communication, the thread just sleeps until the Dispose() method is called by the client.
 *                                                      While in this state, the thread is periodically awoken to update the watchdog counter so that the client can
 *                                                      determine whether the communication port has locked.
 *                                                      
 *                                  4.  Modified the Cleanup() method of the MdiPTU class to close the communication port.
 *                                  
 *                                  5.  Modified the icon associated with MdiPTE. Added the icon file to the Resources directory.
 *                                  
 *  07/31/13    6.7.4   K.McD       The following modifications were carried out as a result of problems associated with moving the 'PTU Configuration Files' directory to
 *                                  the user application data directory. The project identifier is now passed as a command line parameter to the PTU by the desktop
 *                                  shortcut so that, provided that a valid project XML data dictionary file is found in the configuration files directory, each PTU
 *                                  shortcut is associated with a specific project XML data dictionary with the filename '<project-identifier>.PTU Configuration.xml' 
 *                                  e.g. 'R8PR.PTU Configuration.xml'. This means that each PTU project installation will now operate independently whereas previously,
 *                                  each project used the same XML configuration file, 'PTU Configuration.xml'. 
 *                                  
 *                                  On earlier versions of the PTU where the configuration files directory was a sub-directory of the main project start-up directory,
 *                                  this was not an issue as each project had a unique XML data dictionary file. It was only after the configuration files directory was
 *                                  moved to the user application data directory and was common to all installed PTU applications that it became 
 *                                  an issue.
 *                                  
 *                                  1.  Updated Common.dll to version 1.18.3.
 *                                          1.  Modified the LoadDictionary() method of the General class to copy the source file to the file that is defined as the
 *                                              current XML data dictionary file rather than the default XML data dictionary file. The current XML data dictionary filename
 *                                              can specify either: (a) the default XML data dictionary file or (b) the project XML data dictionary file.
 *                                          
 *                                          2.  Added the FilenameDataDictionary property to the IMainWindow interface definition, this specifies the filename of the
 *                                              current XML data dictionary filename.
 *                                          
 *                                  2.  Modified the MdiPTE class.
 *                                          1.  Added the FilenameDataDictionary property in accordance with the modified IMainWindow interface definition.
 *                                          2.  Modified the constructor that is called if any command line arguments are passed to the PTU to update the
 *                                              FilenameDataDictionary property with the filename associated with the project XML data dictionary file if a valid project
 *                                              XML data dictionary file is found.
 *                                          3.  Modified the m_TSBOnline_Click() method to copy the source file to the file that is defined as the current XML data
 *                                              dictionary file rather than the default XML data dictionary file if a new XML data dictionary file is selected as a result
 *                                              of a mismatch between the embedded software version reference and the current data dictionary version reference.
 *                                              
 *  08/01/13    6.7.5   K.McD       1.  Updated Watch.dll to version 1.22.2. Modified the Run() method of the ThreadPollWatch class to close the communication port as soon
 *                                      as the communication fault flag is asserted.
 *                                  2.  Updated the Event.dll class to version 1.17.4. Modified the Run() method of the ThreadPollEvent class to close the communication
 *                                      port as soon as the communication fault flag is asserted so that it is consistent with the Watch.ThreadPollWatch class.
 *                                      
 *  08/02/13    6.7.6   K.McD       1.  Updated Common.dll to version 1.18.4. Increased the width, in pixels, of the name field associated with the watch control from 200
 *                                      to 230 in the WatchControlLayout class to prevent some of the longer variable names being displayed incorrectly. 
 *
 *                                  2.  Updated Event.dll to version 1.17.5. Increased the width of the date field of the event log DataGridView control associated with
 *                                      the FormViewEventLog class from 70 pixels to 75 pixels to allow a 4 digit year code to be displayed in Segoe UI 9 font.
 *                                      
 *  08/02/13    6.7.7   K.McD       1.  Modified the MdiPTU class to fix the bug Bug fix associated with the user message not changing when the font is modified using the
 *                                      Tools/Options menu. Modified the MdiPTU_FontChanged() method to update the Font property of the user message StatusStrip control.
 *                                      
 *  08/05/13    6.7.8   K.McD       1.  Replaced the 'Operating System' legend with 'O.S.' in the FormHelpAbout class to prevent an overlap when using larger fonts.
 *  
 *                                  2.  Replaced the single font setting, Font with FontXP and FontWin7 settings so that there are different font settings for Windows XP
 *                                      and Windows 7 operating systems. The default/initial font for the Windows XP setting was set to Tahoma, 8pt and the default/initial
 *                                      font for the Windows 7 setting was set to Segoe UI - 8.25pt. These fonts are the default fonts for Windows XP and Windows 7
 *                                      respectively.
 *                                      
 *                                  3.  Modified the FormSize setting from 800 x 600 px to 1010  x 720 px so that on first install, the form will be sized to take up the
 *                                      full screen for a display resolution of 1024 x 768.
 *                                      
 *                                  4.  Bug fix associated with an ArgumentException being thrown soon after the user had selected the default font. Removed the call to
 *                                      dispose of the m_Font member variable from the m_BtnDefaultFont_Click() method of the FormOptions class.
 *                                          
 *                                  5.  Modified the FormOptions class to support separate fonts for Windows XP and Windows 7.
 *                                          1.  Created the static GetOSFont() method to get the current font or the default font, depending upon the state of the
 *                                              requestDefaultFont flag, asssociated with the operating system.
 *                                          2.  Created the static SetOSFont() method to set the appropriate font setting, FontXP / FontWin7, depending upon the operating
 *                                              system.
 *                                          3.  Modified the constructor to use the GetOSFont() method to retrieve the current font rather than retrieving it directly
 *                                              from the Font setting.
 *                                          4.  Modified the m_BtnDefaultFont_Click() method to use the GetOSFont() method to retrieve the default font.
 *                                          5.  Modified the m_BtnOK_Click() method to use the SetOSFont() method to set the appropriate font setting rather than writing
 *                                              it directly to the Font setting.
 *                                          6.  Added the MajorBuildXP and MajorBuildWin7 constants to define the values of the Major component of the version number for
 *                                              the Window XP and Window 7 operating systems.
 *                                  
 *                                  6.  When updating the Font property of the Parameter class in the InitializePTU() method of the MdiPTU class, instead of getting the
 *                                      value directly from the Font setting, now calls the FormOptions.GetOSFont() static method to get the font setting (FontXP/FontWin7)
 *                                      that is appropriate to the operating system.
 *                                  
 *                                  7.  Updated Common.dll to version 1.18.5.
 *                                          1.  For all Label controls that make up the VariableControl user control, changed the TextAlign property from MiddleLeft/
 *                                              MiddleRight to TopLeft/TopRight, as appropriate, and modified the Padding property to 0,5,0,0. This prevents misalignment
 *                                              of the display when the width of the text string associated with the label exceeds the width of the label.
 *

 *                                          While in this mode, the PTU displayed the workset parameters that were downloaded from the VCU and gave the user the
 *                                          opportunity to name the workset but not the opportunity to Save the workset. Modify the code to ensure that the new workset

 *                                      'Open/Event Log' screen, the user opens one or more 'Show Flags' dialog boxes and then selects the 'Back' (Esc) key, these
 *                                      dialog boxes are not automatically closed. If the user then tries to close these dialog boxes once the PTU has returned to the
 *                                      Open/Event Log' screen, an exception is thrown. On further investigation it was discovered that these dialog boxes are not
 *                                      automatically closed if the user uses the F4 key to toggle between the 'Replay' and the'YTPlot' screens.

 *                                  4.  The 'Tools/Convert Engineering Database' menu option is to be modified to generate the XML file from two separate (.e1) files.
 *                                      The first file is the engineering data dictionary (.e1) database that is generated automatically from the Database Builder
 *                                      Utility. The second file is a project specific PTU configuration database that contains the following supplemental tables that
 *                                      are required for the correct operation of the PTU: CONFIGUREPTU, DataStreamTypes, LOGS, Security and URI. Partly populated
 *                                      CONFIGUREPTU and LOGS tables are created by the Database Builder Utility in the engineering data dictionary (.e1) database,
 *                                      however, these tables are ignored in the conversion process. The information contained in these partly populated tables can be
 *                                      useful when initially setting up the tables in the project PTU configuration database. 
 *                                      
 *                                      Both files are selected by the user and should be, ideally, located in the 
 *                                      '<User Application Data>\Bombardier\Portable Test Unit\PTU Configuration Files' sub-directory. The convention
 *                                      is to name the project PTU configuration database '<project-id>.PTU Configuration.e1' e.g. R8PR.PRU Configuration.e1.
 *                                      
 *                                      The purpose for this change is that once the project PTU configuration database is set up, new vesions of the XML file can
 *                                      be easily created using the Database Builder Utility as the output of the utility can be directly used to create the new XML 
 *                                      file whereas before, the supplemental tables had to be added manually to the (.e1) file output from the Database Builder Utility.
 *                                      
 *                                  5.  A FunctionFlags bitmask field is to be added to the  CONFIGUREPTU table. This field is a bitmask that specifies the function
 *                                      options that are required for the current project. So far, the following flags have been defined:
 *
 *                                          Bit 0   -   Use4DigitYearCode - Flag to specify whether the project VCU uses a 2 or 4 digit year code. True, if the project
 *                                                      uses a 4 digit year code; otherwise, false.
 *                                          Bit 1   -   ShowEventLogType - Flag to specify whether the event log type field is to be shown when saved event logs are
 *                                                      displayed. True, if the log type is to be displayed; otherwise, false.
 *                                          .
 *                                          .
 *                                          .
 *                                          Bit 7   -   Not Used.
 *                                          
 *                                  6.  The height of the event variable user control and the DataGridView Row Height must be increased to allow characters such as
 *                                      'g', 'j', 'p', 'q', 'y' to be displayed correctly when using the default font.

 *                                      in slides 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the PowerPoint presentation '076_CTA - PTU file pullback from VCU - 20150127.pptx', but does NOT
 *                                      implement the file transfer; it merely calls an empty external batch file from within the PTU application. The second stage,
 *                                      Part 2, implements the batch file that downloads the configuration and help files from the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) to the
 *                                      appropriate directory on the PTU computer. As described in the PowerPoint Presentation, this download is only carried out if the
 *                                      appropriate configuration file is not already present on the PTU computer.
 *                                      
 *                                  2.  An informal review of version 6.11 of the PTU concluded that, where possible - i.e. if the PTU is started from a shortcut
 *                                      that passes the project identifier as a shortcut parameter, the project specific PTU initialization should be carried out
 *                                      in the MDI Form constructor that has the parameter string array as its signature rather than by the LoadDictionary() method.
 *                                      This streamlines the display construction of the Control Panel associated with the R188 project. In the 6.11 implementation
 *                                      the CTA layout is momentarily displayed before the Control Panel is drawn, however, by initializing the project specific
 *                                      features in the constructor, the Control Panel associated with the R188 project is drawn immediately and the CTA layout
 *                                      is not shown at all.
 *                                      
 *                                  3.  Bug Fix - SNCR - R188 PTU [20-Mar-2015] Item 21. It is possible to load a data dictionary that is not associated with the
 *                                      current project, i.e. the project associated with the project identifier that was passed via the desktop shortcut, when using
 *                                      the 'File/Select Data Dictionary' menu option. It is also possible to select the '<project-identifier>.PTU Configuration.xml'
 *                                      file.
 *                                      
 *                                  4.  Bug Fix - SNCR - R188 PTU [20-Mar-2015] Item 22. The toggling of the ToolTipText for the Online and Offline buttons on the
 *                                      R188 project doesnt work correctly.
 *                                      
 *                                  5.  Bug Fix - SNCR - R188 PTU [20-Mar-2015] Item 23. In the Rev. 1.25 implementation of Watch.dll, if the F5-Modify function
 *                                      key of the 'View/Watch' screen is disabled, because, for example, the user is in Maintenance mode and the active workset
 *                                      is at the Engineering security level, and the user selects either the F4-Pause or the F3-Rec function key;
 *                                      the F5-Modify function key remains disabled while the PTU is in the record or the paused state, however, on returning to the
 *                                      normal state, it becomes active. This is incorrect and should be corrected in the next revision.
 *                                      
 *                                  6.  Bug Fix - SNCR - R188 PTU [20-Mar-2015] Item 24. On selecting the Exit function key on the Diagnostics/Event Log and
 *                                      the Diagnostics/Self Tests screens, the cursor doesnt go to the Cursors.WaitCursor cursor on the R188 project.
 *                                      
 *                                  7.  Bug Fix - SNCR - R188 PTU [20-Mar-2015] Item 25. The Font of the NYCT R188, PTU STATUS, MAINTENANCE and
 *                                      ADMINISTRATION  labels is not automatically updated when the user changes the Font via the Tools/Options menu. 
 *

 *                                      2.  On the R188 project only, all references to 'PTU' are to be replaced with 'PTE' and all occurrences of 'Portable Test Unit'
 *                                          are to be replaced with 'Portable Test Equipment'. Where support for multiple legends is not possible, 'Portable Test

 *                                      the configuration file, or, the PTU tries to update the configuration file because of a mismatch between the version of the

 *                                      project-identifier.Configuration.xml do not exist, there is a problem trying to log on as a Factory user in order to

 * 
 *  Date        Version Author          Comments
 *  07/19/11    1.0     K.McD           1.  First entry into TortoiseSVN.
 *  
 *  07/25/11    1.1     K.McD           1.  Changed the values returned in the call to the GetEmbeddedInformation() method.
 *  
 *  08/10/11    1.2     K.McD           1.  Added the constants associated with the call to the GetEmbeddedInformation methods.
 *                                      2.  Included a delay before returning from the DownloadChartRecorderWorkset() method to simulate actual
 *                                          download.
 *                                      
 *  08/24/11    1.3     K.McD           1.  Removed unnecessary constants.
 *  
 *  10/10/11    1.4     K.McD           1.  Changed the modifiers associated with a number of constant strings.
 *                                      2.  Made the car identifier variable static.
 *                                      
 *  05/13/15    1.5     K.McD           References
 *                                      1.  Upgrade the PTU software to extend the support for the R188 project as defined in purchase order
 *                                          4800010525-CU2/19.03.2015.
 *                                      
 *                                          1.  NK-U-6505 Section 2.2. Mandatory MDI Global Screen Representation - Part 1. The proposal is to add additional status
 *                                              labels to the status bar at the bottom of the PTU screen to include ‘Log: [Saved | Unsaved]’ and
 *                                              ‘WibuBox: [Present | Not Present]’. 
 *  
 *                                      Modifications
 *                                      1.  In order to accommodate the additional status labels, the size of the original status labels was reduced. The CarIdentifier
 *                                          constant value, which represents the car-identifier text that is displayed when the PTU is not connected to a physical
 *                                          car, was changed from "No Car" to "-" so that the status message "Car id.: -" would fit inside the status label.
